Update aggregate values in macro simulation - Need to be event based as it has to be developed per model (probably related 
to the reports data collection)

NOTE: HOW DO REPORTS WORK
1. in the xml file, specify a list of reports of two types mainly: CSV or Charts. These reports are linked with a specific 
event and a reportVariable
2. The event trigger the ReportVariable which has to fetch the correct data in the event or somewhere else and update itself
3. When this is done, an  ReportVariableChanged event is launched which automatically updates the CSV or Chart report and 
does the relevant actions (print it on a file or on the GUI).

What we need to do: 
1. Think who and when to launch the specific event
2. Write the correct setting up of the characteristic of the event
3. Write the specific ReportVariable and the updating of its characteristics based on the event thrown.


CONFIGURATION TODOS:
Nested links between market simulations and macrosimulations

REMAINING QUESTIONS:
wage lower and upper bounds for households
Re-think expectations
In the investment strategies for consumption firms, why do we need two id for capital goods and production goods? See RealCapitalDemandWithPayBackPeriod with TODO
Payable stocks and paying stocks
Manage Cash with firms
What happens when an agent dies during a simulation (tax payments and so on)
What happens when all agents of a population die
Reports
Steady State

SIMULATION FEEDBACK: no capital firm sells anything, some bankrupt because do not produce enough because do not get enough money 
and thus cannot hire enough workers but this is strange. Consumption firms do sell allright.

Wages setting and the Adaptive wage class. It is not generic.

Clean-up of the code

- Depositi come quota del redito (antoine)
- Domanda di credito colla pecking order (alessandro)
- Interest rate: risk premium + costo di finanziamento (a o a)
- Profiti?
- Calibrazione di crescita
- Offerta di credito individuale basata sulla probabillita logistica di fallimento ed exposure media a perdite


Nice to have
- Endogenous dividends on the basis of targeted deposits
